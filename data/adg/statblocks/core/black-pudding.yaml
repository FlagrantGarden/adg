description: |
  When the black pudding attacks and misses, reduce the AC of the enemy's armour by 1. If the enemy
  is unarmoured deal 1d3 damage even on failed attacks.

  When struck with slashing or lightning attacks the black pudding divides instead of taking
  damage. Split its HD among the new puddings.

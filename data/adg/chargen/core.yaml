  - id: 1-2
    area: Head
    description: >-
      A flap of skin was sheared away from your scalp, revealing exposed bone. The skin will never
      grow back.
  - id: 1-3
    area: Head
    description: >-
      Your ear becomes permanently swollen and deformed, resembling a cauliflower.
  - id: 1-4
    area: Head
    description: >-
      There's no physical sign that you were injured, but you've become prone to apocalyptic
      headaches that come on without warning.
  - id: 1-5
    area: Head
    description: >-
      The dome of your head is visibly mis-shapen, and helmets don't fit like they used to.
  - id: 1-6
    area: Head
    description: >-
      Hair only grows on one side of your head now. The other side is knotted with scar tissue.
  - id: 2-1
    area: Face
    description: >-
      A broken tooth pierced your lip. Your mouth is crooked and your lip is permanently a little
      swollen.
  - id: 2-2
    area: Face
    description: >-
      The blade caught you in your mouth, slicing straight through your cheek. The scar extends up
      to just below your cheek bone, and it's a beautiful shade of dead-flesh-white.
  - id: 2-3
    area: Face
    description: >-
      You never use all of your teeth at the same time anyway. Don't worry you'll get used to only
      being able to chew on one side eventually.
  - id: 2-4
    area: Face
    description: >-
      The blow shattered your orbital bone, leaving your eye hanging out of your skull. The bones
      didn't set quite right and your eye is visibly lower in your face than it used to be.
  - id: 2-5
    area: Face
    description: >-
      Your nose oozes a small trickle of blood constantly.
  - id: 2-6
    area: Face
    description: >-
      One of your cheeks is noticeably lower than the other, with a visible lump where the bone
      didn't set properly.
  - id: 3-1
    area: Arms
    description: >-
      You fractured your shoulder socket. The joint sometimes catches so your arm locks in place
      and has to be forced back into motion, often painfully. The joint grinds audibly when it
      moves.
  - id: 3-2
    area: Arms
    description: >-
      One of the tendons in your forearm is permanently damaged. Now your hand flops a little too
      far back at the wrist.
  - id: 3-3
    area: Arms
    description: >-
      The bones of your wrist didn't quite line up properly when you healed and now there's a very
      visible misalignment where your wrist joins your hand.
  - id: 3-4
    area: Arms
    description: >-
      Your arm hung limp by your side for so long before you set it and healed that your shoulder
      now sits a little lower than its opposite number.
  - id: 3-5
    area: Arms
    description: >-
      Elbows are made to bend, and that's a good thing because yours will never be able to extend
      fully again.
  - id: 3-6
    area: Arms
    description: >-
      Your arm is twisted so that when you stand the back of your hand sits at a right angle to
      your body, the thumb parallel to your thigh.
  - id: 4-1

    description: >-
      You lose the tip of one of your fingers, just below the nail.
  - id: 4-2
    area: Hands

      The fractured bones of your ring finger rotated slightly during healing and now it overlaps
      your middle finger every time you make a fist.
  - id: 4-3
    area: Hands
    description: >-
      One of your fingers has had all the meat and sinew torn away from it, so that only bone
      remains.
  - id: 4-4
    area: Hands
    description: >-
      The skin of your hand is boiled and charred, like meat left on the fire for too long.
  - id: 4-5
    area: Hands
    description: >-
      The veins in the back of your hand are thick and black like they carry an infection.
  - id: 4-6
    area: Hands
    description: >-
      Pick your favourite finger and say goodbye to it. It's gone now.
  - id: 5-1
    area: Legs
    description: >-
      The bones in your leg were shattered beyond complete repair. That leg will always be
      fractionally shorter than the other.

    description: >-
      One of your feet twists inward at an odd angle, and can never be straightened properly.

  - id: 5-4

  - id: 6-2
    area: Torso

      Most bruises heal. This one didn't. The skin where you were struck is permanently stained a
      dull shade of piss-yellow, with hints of brown and flecks of purple.
  - id: 6-3
    area: Torso
    description: >-
      Your pectoral muscle is separated from the bone, and when it heals your chest on that side is
      lower than the other.
  - id: 6-4
    area: Torso
    description: >-
      A thick knot of scar tissue runs down the center of your chest, as though you have been
      zipped up.

      After breaking all of your ribs on one side, a metal plate was grafted onto your bones. It
      shines through the hole in your missing flesh.

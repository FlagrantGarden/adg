You gain Experience Points (XP) for overcoming challenges and gathering wealth.

For each silver piece you extract from the wilds, you gain 1 XP. Monsters give 100 XP per hit die,
whether defeated, avoided, or captured. All XP earned is split evenly among the party.

When you advance a level, roll your new Health Dice. If the amount rolled is greater than your
current maximum health, increase it to the new total. Otherwise, increase it by one. You do not add
half your Brawn score to this new roll; this bonus is only granted at the first level.

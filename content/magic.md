All characters can learn magic, but it comes at a cost. You can start with as many Rituals as you
dare to learn. If you overextend yourself and your health or any attribute reaches 0, your
character has died. Make a new one.

To learn a Ritual, roll on the [Ritual Generator](#ritual-generator) or choose something from
another game. Then roll 1d3 and reduce either your maximum health or one of your attributes by that
amount permanently. Once you have decided to learn a Ritual you can't change your mind - you have
to roll and pay the price.

New Rituals must be discovered in play. When you discover a new Ritual and try to learn it, roll
1d3 and reduce your maximum health or one of your attributes by that amount permanently. Then roll
under your Cunning on a d20. If the roll succeeds you learn the Ritual. If it fails, that Ritual is
forever lost to you - you can never learn it. You can exert yourself on this roll.

To perform a Ritual, roll under your Cunning on a d20. If you succeed the Ritual takes effect. If
you roll your Cunning score exactly it either lasts twice as long, or is twice as effective (your
choice). If you roll over your Cunning score, the Ritual fails. Roll on the Mishap table, adding
the difference between your failed roll and your Cunning score to your roll.

Rituals that deal damage deal Adventurer Level x 1d6 damage.

There are three kinds of Ritual: Phrases, Sigils, and Ceremonies.

Phrases take no time to cast, occur instantly, and fade as soon as they have taken effect.

Sigils take a minute to draw, can be triggered at will or when a certain condition is met, and
their effects last for ten minutes per Adventurer Level of the caster.

Ceremonies take an hour or more to perform, occur as soon as the ceremony is complete, and their
effects last for one day per Adventurer Level of the caster.

## Ritual Generator

Rituals are made up of three parts - the Ritual Type and two words that are combined to create the
Ritual's effect. Interpret your spells as you see fit and put them to creative use. You've paid the
price to learn them; now they work for you.

## Mishaps

Roll 2d6 + the difference between your failed roll and your Cunning, then apply the effect below.

Unless specified otherwise, you don't remember new Words that replace those in the Ritual you
failed to cast once the Ritual is complete.

## Using Spells From Other Games

Instead of rolling 1d3 when attempting to learn a new Ritual, reduce your maximum health or one of
your attributes by the level of the spell you are attempting to learn.

If the spell you are attempting to learn has no level or is level 0, roll 1d3 as normal.

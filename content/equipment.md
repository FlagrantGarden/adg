You have inventory slots equal to your Brawn minus your AC. Items not worn or carried in the hands
take up slots, and are assumed to be stowed in a backpack.

Each slot can hold up to 200 coins and gems.

## Money

The standard unit of currency is the silver piece (sp), which may be broken into 10 copper pennies
(cp). Fifty silver pieces are worth 1 gold pound (gp).

## Melee Weapons

- _Small._ 4sp. ![roll:1d6-1](. "1d6-1 damage"). Ignores armour when enemies are prone.
- _Medium._ 8sp. ![roll:1d6](. "1d6 damage").
- _Large._ 12sp. ![roll:2d6k1](. "1d6 damage with advantage"). +2 to initiative.

## Ranged Weapons

- _Small._ 4sp. ![roll:1d6-1](. "1d6-1 damage"). -2 to initiative. Reloading is a free action.
- _Medium._ 8sp. ![roll:1d6](. "1d6 damage"). Reloading is a move action.
- _Large._ 12sp. ![roll:2d6k1](. "1d6 damage with advantage"). Ignores armour. Reloading takes an
  entire round.

## Armour and Shields

- _Light._ 30sp. AC 3.
- _Medium._ 50sp. AC 5.
- _Heavy._ 80sp. AC 7.
- _Shield._ 15sp. +1 AC.
- _Helmet._ 10sp. Can be sacrificed to negate a single damage roll.

Unarmoured characters have AC 0.

## Light

The dungeon lacks light. You must provide your own.

A candle, torch, or lantern sheds enough light to illuminate a single room. Every other Turn, a
player with a light makes a light check by rolling the source's light dice. If the result is
greater than 4, increase the number of dice for the next check. The GM may decide to make this
check in place of the players.

- Candle, ![roll:3d6](). _1cp_
- Torch, ![roll:2d6](). _1sp_
- Lantern, ![roll:1d6](). _7sp_

When the light source is threatened by wind or moisture, add an additional die to the roll. If you
fail it goes out, regardless of the number of dice being used.

## Adventuring Gear

The following list includes the mundane equipment your character may want or need for adventuring.
Most items are readily available and may be purchased when resting outside the dungeon in between
adventures.

title: Enemies
weight: 70

Enemies have HDd6 health. When their health reaches 0 they are dead.

Enemy attacks do 1d6 damage unless noted otherwise. When they roll exactly their Attack, their
damage is doubled.

Enemy Attack is equal to 11+HD. Enemies of HD 9 or greater only miss when they roll under their
target's AC. Damage is doubled on a roll of 20.

Enemies make saving throws by rolling under 10 + HD on 1d20. Rolling exactly their number means
they are immune to that effect for the rest of the encounter.

Enemies of HD 1-3 have one attack per Round, HD 4-7 have two attacks, HD 8-11 have three, and HD
12+ have four.

**No. Appearing** indicates an average group size for a given encounter. The GM should adjust this
to taste when creating wandering monster tables and encounters for their own adventures.
